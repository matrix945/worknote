JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes

In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.


External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<script src="myScript.js"></script>

</body>
</html>

You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.



External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

This example uses a full URL to link to a script: 
<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js"></script> 

same folder  <script src="myScript1.js"></script> 
different  <script src="/js/myScript1.js"></script> 



JavaScript Output
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().


Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded, will delete all existing HTML:

<script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>

syntax
Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Numbers are not allowed as the first character.


$$$JavaScript Statements

In HTML, JavaScript statements are "instructions" to be "executed" by the web browser.


$$$JavaScript Comments
//
/* ... */



$$$JavaScript variables
After the declaration, the variable has no value. (Technically it has the value of undefined)
Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma: like var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200; 

Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables

If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.
The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

var x = 2 + 3 + "5" --> 55
var x = "5" + 2 + 3; --->523



$$$JavaScript Operators
== 	equal to
=== 	equal value and equal type
!= 	not equal
!== 	not equal value or not equal type
typeof 	Returns the type of a variable
instanceof 	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
Bitwise Operators IDK
=== 	Strict equal

$$$JavaScript Data Types
var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object 
 var y = 123e5;      // 12300000
var z = 123e-5;     // 0.00123
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];  //array
primitive data 
    string
    number
    boolean
    null
    undefined

	
Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.


In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The typeof is also undefined.
var person;                // Value is undefined, type is undefined
Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.
person = undefined;        // Value is undefined, type is undefined
var person = null;         // Value is null, but type is still an object
var person = undefined;   // Value is undefined, type is undefined
typeof undefined           // undefined
typeof null                // object
null === undefined         // false
null == undefined          // true



$$$JavaScript Functions
var x = myFunction(4, 3);        // Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
    return a * b;                // Function returns the product of a and b
}



The () Operator Invokes the Function

Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.

Accessing a function without () will return the function definition instead of the function result:



function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
    return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius;

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>

<p>Accessing a function without () will return the function definition instead of the function result:</p>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

function toCelsius(f) {
    return (5/9) * (f-32);
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius;
</script>

</body>
</html>

JavaScript Functions

Accessing a function without () will return the function definition instead of the function result:

function toCelsius(f) { return (5/9) * (f-32); }


$$$JavaScript Objects
Accessing Object Methods by . and []
var person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName:"Doe",
    age:50,
    eyeColor:"blue"
}; 

objectName.propertyName objectName["propertyName"]

$$$
You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash: A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \
Dolly!"; 


Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals: var firstName = "John"

But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new: var firstName = new String("John")


dont use new to creat string it will cause some problems like 
 var x = "John";             
var y = new String("John");
// (x == y) is true because x and y have equal values 

 var x = "John";             
var y = new String("John");
// (x === y) is false because x and y have different types (string and object) 

var x = new String("John");             
var y = new String("John");
// (x == y) is false because x and y are different objects

var x = new String("John");             
var y = new String("John");
// (x === y) is false because x and y are different objects

$$$ String method

var str = "HELLO WORLD";

str[0];                   // returns H

This is unsafe and unpredictable:

    It does not work in all browsers (not in IE5, IE6, IE7)
    It makes strings look like arrays (but they are not)
    str[0] = "H" does not give an error (but does not work)


The charAt() Method
The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:

var str = "HELLO WORLD";
str.charAt(0);            // returns H 

$$$ Numbers

NaN - Not a Number

NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.

Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number):
var x = 100 / "Apple";  // x will be NaN (Not a Number)
var x = 100 / "10";     // x will be 10
Numbers Can be Objects

Normally JavaScript numbers are primitive values created from literals: var x = 123

But numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword new: var y = new Number(123)


$$$Array
The Difference Between Arrays and Objects

In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  

In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.
 var person = [];
person["firstName"] = "John";
person["lastName"] = "Doe";
person["age"] = 46;
var x = person.length;         // person.length will return 0
var y = person[0];             // person[0] will return undefined
Use [] instead.

These two different statements both create a new empty array named points:

var points = new Array();         // Bad
var points = [];                  // Good 

 var points = new Array(40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10); // Bad
var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];          // Good 
var points = new Array(40, 100);  // Creates an array with two elements (40 and 100)
 var points = new Array(40);       // Creates an array with 40 undefined elements !!!!!

 
 
 
 
 
$$$JavaScript Hoisting 
JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
To understand this, you have to understand the term "hoisting".
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted
 
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = 5;  // Initialize x
y = 89;
elem = document.getElementById("demo");            // Find an element 
elem.innerHTML = "x is " + x + " and y is " + y;    // Display x and y

var y = 7;  // Initialize y
</script>

</body>
</html> 


---->>>>x is 5 and y is 89




$$$JavaScript Use Strict
Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed:Deleting a variable (or object) is not allowed.
Deleting a function is not allowed.
Duplicating a parameter name is not allowed:
Octal numeric literals are not allowed:
Escape characters are not allowed:
Writing to a read-only property is not allowed:
Writing to a get-only property is not allowed:
Deleting an undeletable property is not allowed:
The string "eval" cannot be used as a variable:
The string "arguments" cannot be used as a variable:
The with statement is not allowed:
For security reasons, eval() is not allowed to create variables in the scope from which it was called:

JavaScript Performance
Statements or assignments that can be placed outside the loop will make the loop run faster. 




$$$
var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

for (x in person) {
    txt += person[x];
}
